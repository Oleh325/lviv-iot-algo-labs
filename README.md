## Lab 1

Task: Implement a deletion method for an AVL tree.

## Lab 2

Task: Implement a flood fill algorithm.

Flood fill algorithm takes in three parameters: starting node, target color and replacement color.

The format of the data in the input file _input.txt_:
- first row: height and width of the field that contains the colored elements (separated by commas).
- second row: coordinates of the starting pixel from which the color change should start.
- third row: replacement color.
- fourth row and lower: array of colored elements.

The _output.txt_ files hould contain the color values of the field cells after performing the replacement.
